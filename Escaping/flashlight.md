Flashlight

Now that you have offically escaped the house. You need to signal a car but with no light in the darkness of the night it's hard.

Looking at the note for the last hint, You read "hanging"

You look around  to see if there could be anything hanging.

Looking up to a tree branch, there is a flashlight with a string tied around it so that it hangs onto the branch.

Reaching for it, you grab it and signal a car coming your way.

The car stops and the driver is kind enough to let you in.
