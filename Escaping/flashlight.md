Flashlight

Now the character has offically escaped the house. He needs to signal a car but with no light in the darkness of the night it's hard.

Looking at the note for the last hint, he reads "hanging"

The character looks around him to see if there could be anything hanging.

Looking up to a tree branch, there is a flashlight with a string tied around it so that it hangs onto the branch.

Reaching for it, he grabs it and signals a car coming his way.

The car stops and the driver is kind enough to let him in.
