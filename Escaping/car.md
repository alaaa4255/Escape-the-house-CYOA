The car

The character tells the driver his address but the driver does not acknowledge it.

The character brushes it off and thinks that the driver heard him and just doesnt want to respond back.

However, as the driver takes the wrong turn and approaches a random house.

The character starts to panick.

The car comes to a stop and the driver turns around to face the character.

"You are demaned to escape another house."

"However, you are given two options.. would you like to play another game of escaping the nect house or would you rather go back to the other house and stay trapped forever ?"

What should the character choose ?
