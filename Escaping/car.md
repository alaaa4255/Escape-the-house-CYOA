The car

You  tell the driver your address but the driver does not acknowledge it.

You brush it off and think that the driver heard you and just doesnt want to respond back.

However, as the driver takes the wrong turn and approaches a random house.

You start to panick.

The car comes to a stop and the driver turns around to face You.

"You are demaned to escape another house."

"However, you are given two options.. would you like to play another game of escaping the nect house or would you rather go back to the other house and stay trapped forever ?"

What do you choose ?
