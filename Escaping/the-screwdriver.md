The screwdriver


You come across a door that seperates the hallway from the living room. Unfortunatly, the door is locked.


You take a look at the paper and are given the hint that the object he needs to use is right under you.

You look around and think hardly for what it might mean.


You see that one of the floor boards is out of the place. You pick it up and finds a scredriver laying there. You pick up the tool and brings it up to the door nob. Then You, smoothly unlock the door and steps into the living room.
