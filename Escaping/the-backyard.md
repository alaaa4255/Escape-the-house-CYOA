The backyard

You are  now out the house and in the backyard where you come across a locked backyard door.

You walk up to the door and notices that this door can not be opened with a key.

It seems to need something stronger.

You look at the note for hints and is told that in order to open this door you will need a hammer. To add on. the notes tells you that the object you needs is under something that moves

Looking around you notice a car. with the feeling that the hammer is under there, you walk to the car and reach under it.

You grab ahold of a heavy object and pulls it out to see the hammer.

You quickly run to the backyard door and smashes it against the door as hard as you can. The door breaks open.
