The window

You are now inside a room that has nothing but a closet. you aren't given any hints.

The doors are locked but this time you can't escape through the door.

you have to escape using the floor length glass window.

No key will open it.

You open the closet doors hoping that there is something you could use to smash the glass window. you see a vase laying in there and don't think twice before grabbing it.

You back up as far as you could from the window and throw the vase at it as hard as you could.

The window shatters and you step out.
