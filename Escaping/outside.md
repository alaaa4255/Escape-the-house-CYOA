Outside

Once the character is outside the house, he sees a river he needs to cross on order to get to the other side. Sadly he does not know how to swim.

Needing a way out, he looks at the hints.

This time his hint is "to cross, use part of a tree"

Confused on what this could mean, he looks around many times to see what he might need.

At the far end corner he sees a huge long log. The character runs to push the log closer to the river.

Once the log is placed directly on the river creating a path he could walk on, he crosses.

When the character is on the other side, he continues.
