The colored doors

When you now enter the living room you come across a set of doors and each of them are different colors. They as well are locked.

You look at the note to get a hint and sees that the object you need to unlock is the color closest to the sun.

You first start to look for the object in question, you easily find the key hidden between the couch cushions.

you then go to unlock the red door.
