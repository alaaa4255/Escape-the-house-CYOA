The colored doors

When the character now enters the living roo he comes across a set of doors and each of them are different colors. They as well are locked.

The character looks at the note to get a hint and sees that the object he needs to unlock is the color closest to the sun.

The character first starts to look for the object in question, he easily finds the key hidden between the couch cushions.

The character then goes to unlock the red door.
