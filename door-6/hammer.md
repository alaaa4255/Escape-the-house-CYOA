# Backyard

As the character completes the puzzle pieces they now enter the backyard. Almost reaching there way out of the house the character notices that the backyard door has a lock.

Using the next note which says, "Under something that moves"
Looking back to find something that moves the character goes on to figure out what could possibly move around the house, realizing their was a car parked outside, the character approaches it and looks underneath the car.

Finding a hammer in which the character realized they can use the hammer to break the lock on the door.
