# Outside

After crossing the river with the help of a tree log.

You manage to escape the house, but with outside being dark at night already you need to find some sort of light..

Thinking of a flashlight, you try to look around for the next note for a clue in which can give you a hint for something valuable.

Under a big patch of tall grass you get curious if their is a note hidden in their so you start to search around, with your efforts you manage to find the next clue which reads "look up tree"

---

Heading back to the house since it's the only place wear it has trees you go back to search around the tree branches.

Spending some time searching around the tree near the river but with no hope around that area you spread out to the other trees near the house.

With a tree around a window of the house you look up and find a lamp, with a rush of adrenaline flowing in you rush to climb the tree to reach the lamp as it's your ticket to escape

Now with some sort of light you get out of the creepy house you we're once in and walk away

---

You notice that near the house is a highway, with hope that a car will pass by and rescue you.

After waiting for a few minutes you start to lose hope..

Until then you notice something aproaching!

You immediately turn on your flashlight to get the unknown object's attention. The mysterious figure turns out to be a car.

With a blasting light towards you it stops and the driver gives you a ride, you thank the driver for the lift as you have your final glance at the house. Wishing that you will never end up in a place like this again.
