# Outside

After crossing the river with the help of a tree log.

The character manages to escape the house, but with outside being dark at night already the charcter needs to find some sort of light..

Thinking of a flashlight, the character looks at the note he has for the next hint he needs to use.

Reading the hint, the character sees, "look up". Confused he tilts his head up and wonders where what he needs could be.

The character then sees a object dangling from a tree brance that he could reach. Reaching up he gets the flashlight that has a string tied to it in order for it to hang on the branch.

With the flashlight now in his hand, he uses it to signal a car.

And finally the character has escaped.
