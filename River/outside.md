Once outside the house the character notices that there is a huge river he needs to cross before actually finally escaping. He feels hopeless when he remebers that he does not know how to swim.

The character decides to either look for another route or attempt to cross the river in any way he could. When the character sees that there is no other route he could use he decides to give up.

Looking at the paper with the many hints he reads, "to cross, use part of a tree". The character is utterly confused. He looks around to see what the hint could mean.

Suddesnly, he realizes that on the far end corner, there is a huge log laying there. He goes and does his best to drag the heavy log back. When it is near the river, he pushes it into to the water, stands up, steps on it, and attempts to sit on the log while placing his legs into the water.

The character then uses his hand as way of paddling to get him to the far other side of the river.

Once at the end, the character hops of the log and heads off to see what he needs to do next.
