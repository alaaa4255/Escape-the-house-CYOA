Metal gates

Now that the character has left the backyard of the house, he runs farther only to find metal gates. He goes to push them open inly to be tased. He relizes that the gates are activated with tasers.

Without wasting time he figures that he has to find a way to deactivate the tasers.

The character sees that the electric plugs are placed inside a box that is pinned to the wall on the corner from the gates.

Opening the box, the character sees that there is so much electric plugs. Some are unplugges and some are plugged.

He reads the notes filled with the notes and sees that the plugs have to crisscross.

Looking at the unplugged wires, he grabs them and plugs them in a way where they now all crisscross.

He walks to the gates and hesitantly feels the metal to see if the taser have sucessfully been deactivated. The metal gate does not tase him. The character slowly pushed the gate open and leaves.
