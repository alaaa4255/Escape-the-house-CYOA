Outside

Once you are outside the house, You see a river that you need to cross on order to get to the other side. Sadly, you do not know how to swim.

Needing a way out, you look at the hints.

This time your hint is "to cross, use part of a tree"

Confused on what this could mean, You look around many times to see what you might need.

At the far end corner You see a huge long log. You run to push the log closer to the river.

Once the log is placed directly on the river creating a path you could walk on, you cross.

When you are now on the other side, You continue.
