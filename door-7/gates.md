# Doors unlocked

Once the backyard door is unlocked the character notices that their is metal gates surrounding the house, these metal gates are set up with a taser. The character takes a look at the note that was left under him, it reads "They crisscross".

Figuring out what this means, the character looks back and find a box near the gates. Once opened the character notices that it is connected to the taser that is set up with the metal gates, having to deal with many wires the character plays around the plus attached to the box. Each plug corresponds to a different place in the box.

After the character realizes this they begin to work on matching each cord to it's attachment, with much struggle the character figures out the plus and de-activates the tasers. Now the character can open the gate without getting tasered.
